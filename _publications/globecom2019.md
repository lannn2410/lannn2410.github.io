Utility providers are gradually deploying social networks as a useful addition to the Smart Grid in order to help engage consumers in energy management and efficient usage. Besides its benefits, is there any negative impact to the Smart Grid? In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of Smart Grid when integrating into social networks, where attackers utilize misinformation propagation in social network to alter electricity customer's behavior with the goal of causing degradation to power infrastructure. Stand in both perspectives of power facility administrator and adversary, we model the vulnerability assessment of the system under an optimization problem, which enables us to provide theoretical analysis and behavior investigation of the system based on the complexity theory. As solving the problem is challenging, we propose heuristic solutions and show their efficiency on assessing the system's vulnerability in the presence of misinformation attacks. Therefore, we conclude that misinformation attacks must be considered when developing the security model for Socially-enabled Smart Grid technology and planning mitigation techniques.
